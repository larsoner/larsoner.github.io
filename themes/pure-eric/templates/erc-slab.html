                    <b>Summary:</b>

Understanding how the brain works in healthy and pathological conditions is considered as one of the challenges for the 21st century. After the first electroencephalography (EEG) measurements in 1929, the 90â€™s was the birth of modern functional brain imaging with the first functional MRI (fMRI) and full head magnetoencephalography (MEG) system. By offering noninvasively unique insights into the living brain, imaging has revolutionized in the last twenty years both clinical and cognitive neuroscience.
After pioneering breakthroughs in physics and engineering, the field of neuroscience has to face two major challenges. The size of the datasets keeps growing with ambitious projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) which will release terabytes of data. The answers to current neuroscience questions are limited by the complexity of the observed signals: non-stationarity, high noise levels, heterogeneity of sensors, lack of accurate models for the signals.
SLAB will provide the next generation of models and algorithms for mining electrophysiology signals which offer unique ways to image the brain at a millisecond time scale. SLAB will develop dedicated machine learning and statistical signal processing methods and favor the emergence of new challenges for these fields focussing on five open problems: 1) source localization with M/EEG for brain imaging at high temporal resolution 2) representation learning from multivariate (M/EEG) signals to boost statistical power and reduce acquisition costs 3) fusion of heterogeneous sensors to improve spatiotemporal resolution 4) modeling of non-stationary spectral interactions to identify functional coupling between neural ensembles 5) development of algorithms tractable on large datasets and easy to use by non-experts. SLAB aims to strengthen mathematical and computational foundations of neuroimaging data analysis. The methods developed will have applications across fields (e.g. computational biology, astronomy, econometrics). Yet, the primary users of the technologies developed will be in the cognitive and clinical neuroscience community. The tools and high quality open software produced in SLAB will facilitate the analysis of electrophysiology data, offering new perspectives to understand how the brain works at a mesoscale, and for clinical applications (epilepsy, autism, essential tremor, sleep disorders).
