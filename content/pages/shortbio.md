I am currently a research scientist at the University of Washington
[Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences](http://ilabs.washington.edu).

My work focuses on data science related primarily to magnetoencephalography (MEG)
and electroencephalography (EEG). My days are spent working on signal
processing, denoising, scientific computing, and software engineering for doing
better science.

In 2010 I graduated from the BU Biomedical Engineering MS/PhD program.
I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan and went to Kalamazoo College.
